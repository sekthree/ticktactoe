# ticktactoe
Learning Python I created this small tictactoe game as part of an early homework assignment.
To play/run this game, place the file where Jupyter notebook can read it, preferrably in your projects folder.
Once opened in Jupyter notebook, run the first cell with all the functions (SHIFT+ENTER), then
run the second cell (SHIFT+ENTER). 
Once the second cell has been run the game will begin running and ask for user input.
The tictactoe board correponds to numbers on a number pad (ten key). The mapping is displayed beside the board for reference.
simply enter the number corresponding to the cell you'd like to place your marker on.
The AI will then place it's marker. The game will proceed until all cells are filled.

GAME ON!
